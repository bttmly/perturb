# TODO

- Explore how to parallelize tests (first thought, create 1 .perturb dir per CPU)

## Plugins
- Figure out how users provide plugins to the library
    - .perturbrc file that is actual Node code
    - putting JS files somewhere that the process can find/require them
    - names of npm modules that can be 'required'

- Example using command line flags/config file to turn on/off mutations
- Example plugging in additional mutation
- Example plugging in additional runner
- Example plugging in alternate AST parser
